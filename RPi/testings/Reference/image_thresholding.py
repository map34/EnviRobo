# Image thresholding: partitioning an image into a foreground and background. 
# It is a type of image segmentation that isolates objects by converting grayscale 
# images into binary images

# c2v.threshold takes in 4 arguments, 1st should be a grayscale source image
# 2nd is threshold value which is used to classify the pixel values. 
# 3rd is the maxVal which represents the value to be given if pixel is more than the threshold value
# 4th provides different styles of thresholding (EX: binary, trunc..etc)
